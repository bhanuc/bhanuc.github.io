title: Few Reasons Why I Hate Microsoft Products
---

I used to be an avid windows user and used to spent time reading windows magazines, collecting software installers(years of slothy connection). Heck even my first interaction with a personal computer started with windows. But as the time passed, Microsoft and its products have irritated me on different levels that I even feel violated. 
NOTE: These views are solely mine and you might disagree with them. Its Perfectly fine, you can try to convince me in the comments below.

## 1. No Respect of User Choice and Privacy.
Everyone is talking about windows 10 stalking features which will listen to you even when you turn switch it off everywhere. Damn it Cortana !! . An upgrade to windows 10 overwrites your favorite applications in favor of Microsoft counterparts. There were a list of other instances inducted due to famed Big Brother inspired Windows 10.
But this isn't the first time Microsoft has done it. Everytime I tried to dualboot windows and my favourite linux/BSD distro, I had to follow a set of procedure to actually the dual boot work. Where most of the distros go out of their way to respect other operating system found on a system, Microsoft ever since the days of Vista or even XP had a habit of overwriting the bootloader with their own which never seems to have given a damn to other OS present on the system. 

## 2. Usability and ease of Use
Damn you windows 8, it was the most pathetic user design where non-tech savy users found themselves in hell . Changing your settings options, confusing locations of shutdown button has been a constant issue. Ever since the debut of Windows 8, I was asked on several occasion about such minor issues.
 I believe windows seems to be on the path of breaking things which were never actually broken pushing a touch interface on non-touchscreen laptops and PCs. It feels deepthroating and occasionally very painful. I have used the metro interface on a touch screen, its a delight and fun to use but this forced convergence seems to be skewed against a non-touch screen user.
