title: OSFiB Indiegogo Campaign
---

OSFiB is an acronym for OPEN SOURCE & FREE IDE in BROWSER.

OSFiB is an In-Browser IDE which converts any VPS to a working environment. I have created this campaign to create an IDE which is lighter and faster than the existing platforms and which can work lag free on 2GB netbooks/chromebooks and on a 3G connections with support for occasional network drops.

I will be writing more about the project, its inspiration, how I created my MVP very soon here. 

You can read more about the campaign [here](http://igg.me/at). 
Please Support the Campaign By Spreading love for OSFiB.
