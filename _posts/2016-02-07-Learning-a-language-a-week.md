I always wanted to become better at C++, but none of my projects actually involved using C++ .
Some of my friends have even suggested C++ as the holy grail of programming, I think I have finally found my tryst with destiny.

So my latest startup idea revolves around libraries written in C++ . Well we don't want to talk about ideas, do we ? 

So this post will be a collection of Good C++ sources that I found suitable for me. 
Remember I have only done a semester course of C and some minor kernel programming in C and I have recently started with C++, 
although my language stack has started looking like a swiss army knife (Ok at so many things, but great at only few. Which can even a good thing) 
This will be a growing list of good references which I find over time.

##1. [Google Developer's Guide] (https://developers.google.com/edu/c++/cpp-in-depth#how-google-works)
Do how the Noogler's do it. Keep in mind, this guide has few graffitee that makes sense inside their company but going through the guide certainly helps, giving confidence.

##2 [C++ tutorial for C users](http://web.archive.org/web/20150430013207/http://www.4p8.com/eric.brasseur/cppcen.html#l1)
I found this gem using a [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1421668/c-tutorial-for-experienced-c-programmer), I know the premise of the question doesn't fit my description exactly but 
the guide is really good but is down now. All thanks to the archive's wayback machine, you can still go through the tutorial.
