The Contemporary world is full of articles, videos, books to help you find a stable match. Stable Match? Who uses the term anyways? Apparently it is used to describe a mutual relationship in which both the partners have the desire to be with each other.
If it isn't, the Indian Arranged Marriage Association (IMAA) backs you up and can give you wonderful results even when the match is unstable (one of the partner is unhappy with the relationship). 

This post is about the Gale-Shapley Algorithm and its implication on your dating experience.

The algorithm itself was developed in the 60s, but even its application can fetch you a Nobel prize (Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley-2012-Economics). It is also used by the universities all over the world including IIT-JEE committee to match students with a course and college of their choice.  Have you ever wondered how do colleges select students out of the pile of the thousands of applications?

Before we go any further, let's revise the results of the famous Gale-Shapley algorithm:
Imagine a group of men and women who want to get married. Every man and woman have their preferences ranked in order. Next, the men all propose to their first choice of women. If a woman gets multiple proposals, she picks her top choice, and the other men move to their second choice, and the process repeats. By the end, everyone has a mate, and while not everyone will have their first choice, no one will want to switch. 

A direct result of this algorithm is that the system is rigged for the group which proposes as that group starts from the top of their list, whereas the group which accepts proposals is stuck with a weaker chances of the best match as per their preferences.

We see multiple applications of this result. In a patriarchal society, where men propose, we observe, women are dependent on men proposing. This is beyond doubt that women have much more choices than their male counterparts but even if we consider it to be an advantage, it is a disadvantage in disguise! Confused? Let me explain. Choices received by women are actually limited and dependent on the men proposing to her.
This choice of proposing gives men advantage over women. The advantage of a man over the other competing man, now that's a different problem altogether.

 In few cultures like the french culture, both men and women actively initiate a relationship. There both the genders have a better chance of getting a better match. 

I hope, till this point this article is not about the do's and don't of the dating world.But the only suggestion that can be directly inferred can be summarised in one sentence. 

>The only winning move is to make a move.

The admission process is usually rigged in the favour of students. The algorithm is apparently actively used in places like dating sites, managing internet traffic, managing airport traffic.
So it matters if a dating platform gives you the right to propose in their matching algorithms. So next time you login onto OkCupid, make a move.
