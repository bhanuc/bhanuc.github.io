<p>It has been at-least 8 years when I had first read “Wings of Fire” an autobiography of our Late President Dr Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam. Apart from his full name, I did come to know a lot about his early life hardships which seems to have motivated me for a major part of my late teens and early adulthood.</p>

<p>I am a final year Civil Engineering Student at IIT Kanpur and I am heavily opinionated towards use of technology in major part of life. This semester I realized none of my Courses had a course website. After a quick survey amongst the students of different streams, I realized that apart from CSE it was rare for a subject to have course website. There were many mediums used by the professors like Piazza, Moodle, Brihaspati(IITK’s inhouse LMS), emails, google drive to deliver update related to the course.</p>

<p>Plethora of Solutions employed for such a simple problem and none of them actually increases the ease of the student enrolled. He still has to log on and keep an eye on the updates manually.</p>

<p>Updates related to course-ware usually get lost amongst the Daily Bombardment lost &amp; Found Spam. So I decided to take fresh perspective on the problem and Kalam was born.</p>

<p>Kalam essentially is a Cross Platform Desktop Application which allows 3-Step Creation and Update of a Course Website. It currently supports themes, SFTP Push, Zip creation while many interesting features in pipeline like github-pages integration, Android Client for students so they can easily get updates about their enrolled courses. Yes currently the Student has to manually look for updates, but its on a single responsive page. We will improve on this very soon.</p>

<p>The Project is still in its nascent stages (Only 10 days old to be precise) but given the positive feedback I have received, I am really optimistic that this tool will be loved and used by many. </p>

<p>Kalam will be in Beta for a good part of this year and hopefully see a Stable Release in December ’15. You can show your love for the project by at https://github.com/navya/Kalam . Do drop by, we won’t bite .</p>

<p>I will keep posting about Kalam and interesting things in my life. Follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/bhanu423">@bhanu423</a> and Subscribe to my Blog <a href="http://bhanu.io/rss/">here</a>  .</p>
